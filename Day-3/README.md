# Day 3 - Control Flow and Logical Operators

## Project
Create a "TreasureIsland" app.  The goal is to find the treasure in a choose your own adventure style text game.

## Description
This recreates the third day project from [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) written in Go.

I am working through the class at work in Python, and on my own time am re-implmenting my solutions in Go as a way to strengthen ideas, but also learn another programming language.

## Setup & Run Instructions

## Lessons Learned
Today I learned how to evaluate strings in Go.  I also had to look up the `strings.ToLower()` function.  Finally looking up how to exit a program.  I should come back and see if there's a better way to catch the "game over" state, so it doesn't throw an exit code like it does now.
