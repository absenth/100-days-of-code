# Day 4 - Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Project
Today's project is to create the game Rock Paper Scissors.  This is an introduction into both conditional statements, as well as an introduction to how to randomly select items.

## Description
This recreates the second day project from [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) written in Go.

I am working through the class at work in Python, and on my own time am re-implmenting my solutions in Go as a way to strengthen ideas, but also learn another programming language.

## Setup & Run Instructions

## Lessons Learned
Today most of my learning was around how to use the `math/rand` module.  I think the idea of using the `time.Now().UnixNano()` to set the seed is an interesting way to improve the psudo random number generator.
